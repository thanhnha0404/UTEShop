## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No drinks found" error**:
   - Run `npm run seed` first to create basic categories and drinks

2. **Database connection errors**:
   - Ensure your `.env` file has correct database credentials
   - Make sure the database server is running

3. **Memory issues with large datasets**:
   - Reduce the number of users/orders in the script
   - Run the basic seed first, then advanced seed

### Performance Tips

- For faster seeding, reduce the number of records
- Run scripts during off-peak hours
- Ensure adequate database memory allocation

## Data Verification

After running the seeds, you can verify the data by:

1. **Check user count**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`
2. **Check order count**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;`
3. **Check order status distribution**: `SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY status;`
4. **Check monthly revenue**: Use the statistics dashboard at `/statistics`

## Support

If you encounter issues with the seeding scripts, check:
1. Database connection settings
2. Required dependencies are installed
3. Database has sufficient space
4. No foreign key constraint violations
